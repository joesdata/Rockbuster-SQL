A SQL query utilising a common table expression(CTE) which displayed the top 5 countries where the top 5 customers are located and the total customer count for that country.

WITH top_5_customers (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city, total_amount_paid) AS
  (SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name AS "customer first name", A.last_name AS "customer
  last name", D.country, C.city,

    INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
    INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
    INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
    INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
    WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Acua', 'Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Ambattur', 'Shanwei', 'Teboksary',
                  'Tianji', 'Cianjur', 'So Leopoldo')
    GROUP BY country, city, first_name, last_name, A.customer_id
    ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
    LIMIT 5)
 SELECT D.country,
